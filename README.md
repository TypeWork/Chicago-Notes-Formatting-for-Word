# chicago-notes-formatting

*chicago-notes-formatting* provides Microsoft Word macros (VBA scripts) that format footnote and endnote marks based on the recommendations of both the *Chicago Manual of Style* (17th edition) and Turabian's *A Manual for Writers* (9th edition).

Specificially, in the footnote and endnote ranges, note marks are formatted without superscript. A period is also placed immediately following each note mark, except when symbols are used for that type of note.
